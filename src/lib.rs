//! # An actor/thread orchestration library
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! - next to no boilerplate - see examples
//! - works with `stable` compiler, but requires 2018 edition
//! - no external dependencies except for `std`
//! - enum-based communication over MPSC channels
//! - by default, one actor = one thread
//! - by default, actors only accept messages, they do not send replies
//!   - solution to sending replies is not the most elegant right now,
//!     see "Advanced example" below
//! - network RPC should be possible but is beyond the scope of this crate.
//!   If you want to do this, you can use `input_derive` and `custom_code` to
//!   derive `Serialize` and `Deserialize`.
//! - two procedural macros - see [`movie_derive`](../movie_derive/index.html)
//! - actors need to be defined in module/crate scope
//! - bad error messages for now, macro + manual string parsing magic
//! - in case of large breaking changes in (stable) `TokenStream::to_string()`,
//!   the macros may break
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! The examples below are test-`ignore`d as AFAIK it's impossible to run procedural
//! macros in doc-tests. They are also in `tests` directory, where they are tested.
//!
//! ### Installation
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! "movie" = "0.1"
//! ```
//!
//! ### Simple actor
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use movie::actor;
//!
//! actor! { SimplestActor } // completely useless
//!
//! actor! {
//!     SimpleActor
//!         input: Ping,
//!         on_message:
//!             Ping => (),
//! }
//!
//! #[test]
//! fn test_simple_actor() {
//!     use SimpleActor::{Actor, Input};
//!     // Create and spawn the actor
//!     let actor = Actor {}.start();
//!
//!     actor.send(Input::Ping);
//!     actor.stop(); // Will block, waiting for actor.
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Advanced example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use movie::actor;
//!
//! use std::sync::mpsc::Sender;
//! actor! {
//!     StreamParsingActor
//!         public_visibility: true,
//!         docs: /// Actor that parses video from V4L2 device
//!               /// It's very consistent - failed every time so far.
//!         input:
//!             ChangeSource(String),
//!             SendState,
//!         // By default, Input enum does not have any trait auto-implemented.
//!         input_derive: Debug, PartialEq,
//!         // Whitespace and comments are irrelevant.
//!         // It's also optional to end sections (attributes) with a comma, with
//!         // exception of code attributes (on_stop, on_init etc.), which should
//!         // not end with comma, but rather either with nothing or with a semicolon.
//!         data:
//!             pub device: String,
//!             pub state_tx: Sender<u64>,
//!         on_init:
//!             if self.device == "admin secret device" {
//!                 panic!("No access right for admin secret device");
//!             }
//!             let mut lines_parsed = 0; // This variable will be exposed to on_message.
//!                                       // This is suboptimal, but it is the simplest
//!                                       // way to allow for thread-local variables (`data`
//!                                       // is sent between threads, so it couldn't be used
//!                                       // e.g. for GTK references)
//!         on_message:
//!             ChangeSource(name) => {
//!                 self.device = name;
//!             },
//!             SendState => {
//!                 self.state_tx.send(lines_parsed).unwrap();
//!             }
//!         tick_interval: 5, // Every 5ms, default = 100
//!         on_tick: // on_message have priority over on_tick
//!             lines_parsed += 1;
//!         on_stop: ()
//!         // custom_code must end with a semicolon
//!         custom_code:
//!             pub const DEFAULT_DEVICE: &'static str = "video0";
//! }
//!
//! #[test]
//! fn test_stream_parsing_actor() {
//!     use StreamParsingActor::{Actor, Input, DEFAULT_DEVICE};
//!
//!     use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
//!     let (tx, rx) = channel();
//!     let cfg = Actor {
//!         device: DEFAULT_DEVICE.to_string(),
//!         state_tx: tx,
//!     };
//!     // Spawn the actor, let on_init run
//!     let actor = cfg.start(); // returns StreamParsingActor::Handle
//!
//!     use std::thread::sleep;
//!     use std::time::Duration;
//!     sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
//!
//!     // We can use auto-derived traits on Input
//!     actor.send(dbg!(Input::SendState));
//!     println!("Ticked {} times in 100ms", rx.recv().unwrap()); // 20
//!
//!     actor.stop();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Actor attributes
//!
//! These words if followed by colon, are restricted keywords.
//!
//! - `input` - defines `Input` enum
//! - `input_derive` - `#[derive()]` for `Input` enum
//! - `data` - actor stateful variables, need to be set when creating actor
//! - `on_init` - runs just before an actor starts accepting messages
//! - `on_message` - defines `match message` logic
//! - `tick_interval` - time in milliseconds between tick. When undefined, set to 100ms.
//!    Affects message polling, so don't set it too high.
//! - `on_tick` - runs every tick
//! - `on_stop` - runs just after an actor stops accepting messages
//! - `spawner` - name of the function that spawns thread (by default
//!   `std::thread::spawn`, put a function with similar signature here to have actors be run
//!   as futures, M:N threads etc.)
//! - `spawner_return_type` - return type of `spawner` (by default
//!   `std::thread::JoinHandle<()>`)
//! - `custom_code` - code to be inserted into generated actor module
//! - `public_visibility` - if `true`, then the actor module is public
//! - `docs` - place docs here - e.g. `docs: /// An actor`
//!
//! Some code can break macro internals (e.g. `break` or `continue` without
//! defining your own loop can break actor's main loop, putting `on_stop: (),` will result
//! in an invalid comma). Debugging it can be cryptic, hopefully `actor_dbg` (when the code
//! doesn't compile) and `cargo expand` (when it does) will help you in such situations.
//!
//! ## History
//!
//! Previously, I've written [`x11-input-supercharger`], an utility for auto-scrolling
//! and conditional mouse-to-keyboard rebinding (without changing the keymap itself,
//! which causes Chromium-based applications to freeze for a second). It had many threads
//! running - one for auto-scrolling, other for rebinding, another for polling X11
//! events, and yet another for displaying GTK3 window with Windows-like indicator
//! of auto-scrolling state. The code was not that complex, and the messaging hierarchy
//! was simple (parent messaged its children, never the other way around), yet the boilerplate
//! grown to become quite a hindrance when it comes to code readability, especially since
//! the threads also had to do their own work in addition to reacting to messages
//! (the work includes interacting with X11, GTK3, and tracking time). Instead of using
//! [`actix`], I decided to try to implement my own library, inspired by [`actress`], and
//! spent about 12 hours doing so (I'm far from being a fluent Rust programmer, also, this
//! was my first time using procedural macros).
//!
//! This is my first "real" library (my previous crates/Rust programs were CLI/GUI utilities,
//! sometimes with simple public Rust API). I published some of them to crates.io, but not all
//! (some are on [Github], some not published yet). I learned about procedural macros (mostly about
//! their current shortcomings) - sadly, there are not many good resources about them.
//! I sticked mostly to Rust reference. Surprisingly, I was also unable to quickly Google the
//! "right" way to do documentation (with links and examples) - so I used the first edition of Rust
//! book. I should probably finally read the second edition to familiarize myself with what's
//! inside and where it is (back when I started, there was no second edition yet).
//!
//! ## Usage in the wild
//!
//! If you use this library in your project, consider putting it here (if possible). It will
//! help me with testing whether the new change I introduce breaks anything.
